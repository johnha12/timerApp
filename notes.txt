project
- display timer
- show animation


pseudo code
- event listener to click start button
- draw full border around timer
- start counting down
- update border each time counts down
- update text each time it counts down
- once count down
  - reset border
  - reset count down

notes
- code basically listens for an event. 
then other code execute for something else to happen
- can implement so that one block of code can execute for some event
- instead of lines that alternate code, we're aiming for 1 solid block of code
  js class around DOM elements
- class Timer => start(), pause(), onDurationChange(), tick()
  no animation, just timer. class will have constructor function
- constructor will have duration input, start button and pause button

- value of this inside arrow function is first valid line above arrow function
- value of this for call/apply/bind is whatever is the first argument
- value of this for other cases is whats left of the "."

- can make sure value of this is always the same with arrow function. 
  console.log() within the class
- bind works too. put it in the eventlistener

- undate timer with tick() method
- store time remaining in input element. old way but learning purpose
- new way is to store in js code.

- can get a function and set a function, get/set keyword
- hidden away complexity

- next is animation border. will set up something to watch for events to occur

- want callback parameter to be optional

- goal is to have animated bold border, depleting
- need more than CSS borders to do animation
- SVG scalable vector graphics
  Needs x and y axis as coordinates. Nees origin too.
  can put stuff in SVG; draw anything in it.
  next will draw a line on a clear circle.

- SVG circle => fill and stroke

- use negative offset to get clockwise direction
- rotate entire circle counter-clockwise 90 degrees, to start from top of circle
- next pass in values, instead of hardcoding them

- math: start: dasharray = perimeter, dashoffset = 0
  end: dasharray = perimeter, dashoffset = -1 * perimeter
  offset = (perimeter * timeRemaining) / totalDuration - perimeter

- icons using Font Awesome library
